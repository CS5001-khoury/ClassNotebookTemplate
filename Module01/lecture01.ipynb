    "   * Tech companies should try to anticipate how their tech can be used\n",
    "   * Should they even try? Do they have a social responsibility? \n",

    "   * Tech adds to tech. \n",
    "3. Technology comes in packages, big and small.\n",
    "   * From the nuclear bomb to the smart watch\n",
    "4. Although technology might be a prime element in many public issues, nontechnical factors take precedence in technology-policy decisions.\n",
    "   * Corollary - people who do not know about tech, make the laws about tech - unless we intervene\n",
    "5. All history is relevant, but the history of technology is the most relevant.\n",
    "   * As tech leads to tech\n",
    "6. **Technology is a very human activity.**\n"
